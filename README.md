- 👋 Hi, I’m @varvaravee
- 👀 I’m looking for full-stack developer opportunities in a fast-paced environment, with tons of collaboration.
- 🌱 In my current position, I am writing scripts in Python to automate boring tasks for my coworkers, polishing my React and JavaScript skills while designing a password manager, and learning embedded systems concepts through designing a remote controlled car for land surveying.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects or to help you solve a problem!
